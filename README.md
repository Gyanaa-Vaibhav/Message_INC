## Installation and Setup

### Prerequisites
- Node.js (v16+ recommended)
- PostgreSQL
- Redis

### Backend Setup
1. Clone the repository:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/Gyanaa-Vaibhav/Message_INC.git
   cd Message_INC/Backend
   ```

2. Install dependencies:
   ```bash
   npm install
   ```

3. Configure environment variables:
   Create a `.env` file in the `Backend` directory with the following:
   ```env
   SERVER_PORT=9999
   DB_HOST=localhost
   DB_USER=your_postgres_user
   DB_PASSWORD=your_postgres_password
   DB_NAME=chat_app
   REDIS_HOST=localhost
   ACCESS_SECRET=your_access_secret
   REFRESH_SECRET=your_refresh_secret
   DEPLOYMENT_IP=http://localhost:3000
   ```

4. Start the backend server:
   ```bash
   npm start
   ```

### Frontend Setup
1. Navigate to the `Frontend` directory:
   ```bash
   cd ../Frontend
   ```

2. Install dependencies:
   ```bash
   npm install
   ```

3. Configure environment variables:
   Create a `.env` file in the `Frontend` directory with the following:
   ```env
   VITE_SERVER_IP=http://localhost:9999
   VITE_SOCKET_IP=http://localhost:3000
   ```

4. Start the frontend server:
   ```bash
   npm run dev
   ```

## How It Works

1. **User Authentication**:
   - Users can register/login or join as a guest.
   - JWT is used for authenticated routes and socket connections.

2. **Rooms and Messaging**:
   - Users can join specific rooms for focused discussions.
   - Messages are emitted to all clients in a room in real-time.

3. **Data Persistence**:
   - Messages are cached in Redis for quick retrieval.
   - PostgreSQL stores messages and user data for persistence.

4. **Typing Indicators**:
   - Real-time typing status updates are sent to all room participants.
